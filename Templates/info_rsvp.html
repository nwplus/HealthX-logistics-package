<p>Subject: HealthX 2021: Here&apos;s what you need to know! &#x1F4CB;</p>
<p>Hey there! &#x1F44B;</p>
<p>HealthX is coming right up around the corner, and we hope that you are as excited as we are! </p>
<p>To help you prepare, here is an [Attach PDF Info Package here] that contains all you need to know about the event, and to give you a sneak peak about all the workshops and activities that we have in store for you! </p>
<p>Before you arrive, here are some important reminders:</p>
<p><strong>Waivers</strong></p>
<p>All hackers <strong>must</strong> individually print and sign the following 2 waiver forms to participate at the event. If you are <strong>under 19,</strong> a parent/guardian must sign the waivers as well! You can choose to <strong>sign it digitally and send it back to us</strong> at logistics@nwplus.io, or <strong>print it out, sign it, and bring it to the event.</strong></p>
