### Hacker Info Email

Subject: HealthX 2021: Here's what you need to know! 📋

Hey there! 👋

HealthX is coming right up around the corner, and we hope that you are as excited as we are! 

To help you prepare, here is an [Attach PDF Info Package here] that contains all you need to know about the event, and to give you a sneak peak about all the workshops and activities that we have in store for you! 

Before you arrive, here are some important reminders:

**Waivers**

All hackers **must** individually print and sign the following 2 waiver forms to participate at the event. If you are **under 19,** a parent/guardian must sign the waivers as well! You can choose to **sign it digitally and send it back to us** at HealthXLogistics@gmail.com, or **print it out, sign it, and bring it to the event.**

**HealthX 2021 Waiver:** [http://bit.ly/nwhacks2020-liability](http://bit.ly/nwhacks2020-liability)

**Consent to Use of Image:** [http://bit.ly/nwhacks2020-use-image](http://bit.ly/nwhacks2020-use-image)
****

**Communication**

Slack will be the primary mode of communication between hackers, mentors, and organizers. It is **essential** that all hackers have access to our Slack workspace as this is where all important announcements (like meal time!) and information about project submissions will be posted. We have dedicated channels for event-wide announcements, team formation, mentor help, 3D-printing, and more!

**Join our Slack workspace : [Link to Slack workspace here]**

**Check-In**

Please check-in to the event at [Venue address] between [Time period]. **Remember to bring your signed waivers** (if you haven't sent them to us) **and some form of school or government issued ID.** You will be able to check-in any heavy electronics or valuables with us before walking over to the opening ceremony. 

*P.S.* To see instructions and rules about project submissions, all $50,000+ worth of prizes, and our list of judges, check out [Devpost link]

*(optional blurb about sponsor codes)*

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to email us at HealthXLogistics@gmail.com or message us on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nwplusubc/) page. That's all for now - see you this weekend!
