## Git 101
This workshop introduces hackers to Git and GitHub. Git is a form of version control software and GitHub is a site that allows programmers to share or publish their code. Traditionally, nwPlus has hosted the Git101 workshop alongside the Hackathon101 workshop, as both are directed at first time hackers. Follow the link to access a copy of the Git101 powerpoint used for nwHacks 2020. That particular workshop used slides from Kristen Kwong, a former nwPlus member. The nwHacks background has been deleted, and can be replaced with a HealthX background. It is recommended to only change what is necessary (information of host, date, etc.).
