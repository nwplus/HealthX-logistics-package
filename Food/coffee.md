# â˜•  Coffee

Usually we order from the closest Starbucks.

**Be sure to call ahead and ask about :**
- What times they can accommodate pick ups
- How much you should call in advance every time you want to pick up
- How and when can you pay
- How many 2.5 gallon and 5 gallon cambros they can get for the weekend of the event.
    - These are nice because they keep coffee really HOT and are more eco-friendly ðŸ˜Š
  
### Things to note :

- Price is $115 for 5 gallons of drip coffee + tax everything included
- Starbucks locations on campus will charge for cups, the village and tech location do not
- There will be at least 2 containers of coffee (one for mentors and one for hackers)
- If you are getting cambros refilled, make sure the store has extras on hand, so you can drop off the old ones and pick up new ones.
