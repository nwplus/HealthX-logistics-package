MLH provides hackathon organizing mentors as well as a hardware rental lab for your hackathon. The application to be a MLH member event needs to be done <strong>4 months before the event date.</strong> To apply the follow items are needed : <strong>Venue confirmation, <a href="Miscellaneous_Items/Misc.html">Itemized event budget</a>, <a href="Miscellaneous_Items/Misc.html">Sponsorship package</a>, Potential sponsors list.

<ul>
<li>We generally have speakers at opening ceremonies, closing ceremonies, and sometimes workshops.

<li>Photos and other media can really help when promoting the event in future years. Hackers and sponsors also generally appreciate photos of them with other attendees at the event. Photographers can be organizers or volunteers that have experience with photography. They should be compensated with swag and food for helping out with the event. General photos of of hackers are good for most of the event, always try to get a variety of people. <strong>There will be some attendees that do not consent to having their photo taken.</strong> These attendees should wear a highlighted nametag or something that will make them easily identifiable to photographers.</li>

<p><strong>Send out hacker RSVP form</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Send out RSVP forms to collect basic information about the hackers. Send out the RSVP email to more hackers than the event&apos;s capacity. We usually expect about a 40%- 50% of the people who RSVP to show up. After initial spots are filled up, everyone else should go onto a waitlist. RSVP form linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AHM_ANo98bwuVD3V-1XnIOrDv6-gh77iluCgw2UWyd0/edit" target="_blank">here</a> and email can be found <a href="Templates/info_rsvp.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Close mentor applications and send out <a href="Templates/info_rsvp.html">mentor information email</a> and <a href="Participant_Experience/mentor_info_package.html">mentor information email</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Send waivers to hackers by email</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hackers need to sign image/media waivers and liability waivers before attending the event. If hackers do not want to be photographed they need to specify this at registration on the day of the event. The forms can either be printed out or signed digitally and emailed back to the organizing team. Find the waivers <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wBJgHg1_yV9YfHGYQAqnSbi6gxtqDQRq?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> on google drive.</li>

<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Create Slack workspace</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Slack is the main form of communication with the hackers during the event. Each channel has a specific purpose and special permissions. It is recommended to get familiar with how to use Slack before the event.  Leverage it to communicate clearly and to engage with attendees.</li>
<li>Most of the channels are self explanatory and have different permissions for hackers and organizers. Make sure to have organizers monitoring the slack for issues, questions and misuse. Optionally we will hold contests (trivia, guessing games) for small prizes in one of our slack channels.<ul>
<li>Examples include: #announcements #ask-organizers #slack-contest #random #general #ask-mentors #ask-sponsors #sponsor-1...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is advised to write out template Slack messages before the day of the event, so that things will go faster. Some recommended messages to pre-write would be :<ul>
<li>Announcing mealtimes</li>
<li>Announcing workshops</li>
<li>Announcing mini events</li>
<li>Submission deadlines</li>
<li>Judging instruction</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Set up Devpost</strong> </p>

The Devpost for HealthX can be found here: <a href="https://healthx-2021.devpost.com/" target="_blank">healthx-2021.devpost.com</a>. Devpost allows the hackers to share their project and for organizers to assign winners and prizes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Schedule in organizers and volunteers</strong></p>
