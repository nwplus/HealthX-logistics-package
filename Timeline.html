<p><strong>Apply to be a MLH Member event</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Major League Hacking (MLH) is a company that operates a league for student hackathons. By partnering with them, HealthX will be added to their roster of hackathons and they will provide guidance and help along the planning process. MLH provides hackathon organizing mentors as well as a hardware rental lab for your hackathon. The application to be a MLH member event needs to be done <strong>4 months before the event date.</strong> To apply the follow items are needed : <strong>Venue confirmation, <a href="Miscellaneous_Items/Misc.html">Itemized event budget</a>, Sponsorship package  (Link) , Potential sponsors list. Apply here :</strong> <a href="https://mlh.io/event-membership" target="_blank">https://mlh.io/event-membership</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Sometime custodial services or security is required for a venue. Please make sure that these requirements are satisfied and that staying overnight is allowed at the venue if that is something that you would want hackers to do!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="&#x1F352;-3-months">&#x1F352; 3 Months</h3>

<ul>

<li>If the venue does not come with the needed equipment then it needs to be rented or purchased. Generally these items include table, chairs, power bars, or anything needed to serve food.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Start looking for speakers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We generally have speakers at opening ceremonies, closing ceremonies, and sometimes workshops. It is good to contact and search for speakers early to ensure you can get speakers that are diverse and are a good fit for the hackathon&apos;s goals. For HealthX it would be good to get a mix of people from life sciences and tech.</li>
</ul>

<li>Photos and other media can really help when promoting the event in future years. Hackers and sponsors also generally appreciate photos of them with other attendees at the event. Photographers can be organizers or volunteers that have experience with photography. They should be compensated with swag and food for helping out with the event. General photos of of hackers are good for most of the event, always try to get a variety of people. <strong>There will be some attendees that do not consent to having their photo taken.</strong> These attendees should wear a highlighted nametag or something that will make them easily identifiable to photographers.</li>

<ul>

It is recommended to get familiar with how to use Slack before the event.  Leverage it to communicate clearly and to engage with attendees.  (Link to slack)</li>
<li>Most of the channels are self explanatory and have different permissions for hackers and organizers. Make sure to have organizers monitoring the slack for issues, questions and misuse. Optionally we will hold contests (trivia, guessing games) for small prizes in one of our slack channels.<ul>
<li>Examples include: #announcements #ask-organizers #slack-contest #random #general #ask-mentors #ask-sponsors #sponsor-1...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is advised to write out template slack messages before the day of the event, so that things will go faster. Some recommended messages to pre write would be :<ul>
<li>Announcing mealtimes</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Schedule in organizers and volunteers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organizers and volunteers should be shifted into the schedule. It is usually a good idea to have one organizer and a couple of volunteers per task.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="&#x1F389;-post-event">&#x1F389; Post event!</h3>
<p><strong>Do a retrospective</strong> </p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Send post event emails</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The post event emails should recap the event, thank you sponsors and mentors and include a link to feedback forms : (Link to post event emails and feedback form)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow up with travel reimbursements</strong></p>
<ul>
