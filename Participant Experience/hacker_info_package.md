# Hacker info package

The hacker info package provides information to hackers on things such as schedule, venue map, facilities available, food, judging, sponsors, etc. The Powerpoint is usually sent out to hackers about a week before the day of the hackathon. A copy of the nwHacks 2020 hacker info package is linked below for reference. The theme has been removed, and a HealthX theme can be inserted when ready. The content will also need to be modified to suit HealthX.
