<p>On behalf of nwPlus, we would like to personally thank you for volunteering your time to help make <code>HACKATHON NAME</code> a reality.

<p>&#x1F9E0; Meet and bond with new people that share similar interests as you</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>What is it like being a volunteer?</strong></p>
<p>  As a volunteer, you can experience a hackathon without the need to hack and compete in it, while also having a mini behind the scenes view of how the organization of hackathons plays out during the event! Responsibilities include but are not limited to registration, set-up and take-down, serving meals, and more.  Volunteer hours are flexible and food and drinks will be provided.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What happens if I&apos;m running late for my shift or I cannot attend anymore? &#x1F3C3;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;</strong></p>
<p>  If you are late or cannot attend anymore on the day of the event, please contact your primary volunteers contact through Slack - you should know who this is! </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What if I want to stay after my shift has ended? &#x1F559;</strong></p>
<p>  By all means, go for it! We can always use an extra pair of helping hands, and you&apos;re free to leave whenever your shift is over. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Do I need to bring anything? &#x1F392;</strong></p>
<p>  Wear some comfortable shoes (you&apos;ll be moving around a lot!), and anything else you might need to feel at home (e.g. snacks, scarf, hoodie). Feel free to bring your own laptop and charger, but these are optional. </p>
