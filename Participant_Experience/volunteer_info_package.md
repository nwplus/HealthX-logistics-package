### Intro and Expectations
On behalf of nwPlus, we would like to personally thank you for volunteering your time to help make `HACKATHON NAME` a reality. While you are volunteering as event support staff, you are also essentially playing a bigger role: an nwPlus Ambassador! You will be representing nwPlus and your volunteer experience will directly impact the hacker experience. We're super stoked to have you, and we hope you're excited too! üòç

Whether you applied to make a contribution to the community, to network and meet new people, or even simply because you want to volunteer with your friends, we are immensely grateful for your time. By volunteering with us, you will be able to:

üìù Use your skills and experience and apply it to real-world situations

üí™ Explore your own strengths and gain new skills

üëî Network with industry professionals and improve job opportunities

üß† Meet and bond with new people that share similar interests as you

üåü Make a positive contribution to the community

While enacting as a volunteer and representative of cmd-f we expect you to:

- Arrive on time, be punctual
- Be courteous, polite, and respectful to others
- Be flexible in accepting new tasks and duties
- Communicate concerns and ask questions!
- Comply with *MLH Code of Conduct*
- Wear your volunteer t-shirt and name tag
- Have Slack installed on your phone & join the hackathon workspace
- Use inclusive language (e.g. ‚ÄúHey everyone/friends/y‚Äôall!‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúHey guys!‚Äù)
- 
### Communication

Communication is key, and **all volunteers must be part of [our awesome Slack workspace!](https://bit.ly/2P0IqMC)** Please register and log-in as soon as possible, as well as **set your display name to "<insert name here> (volunteer)"**. This way we can add you to our *private* **#volunteer** channel. Additionally, please read through the following information to be prepared for the hackathon when you arrive:

1. Arrive 10-15 minutes early and check in with any of the nwPlus organizers in the Organizer/Volunteer room (**`ROOM`**) - here you will also receive your volunteer name tag and t-shirt which you will wear for the duration of your shifts. Feel free to leave your stuff here, this room will be monitored at all times. ü™ê
2. Head off to your assigned shift location. Once there, report to the "boss" of your shift and await further instructions. üåù
3. Feel free to message the **#volunteers-photographers** channel on Slack or reach out to nwPlus organizers if you are lost or need any help! üôã
4. During your shift, do not be afraid to let the nwPlus organizers know if you have any questions or concerns about your task, including if you are feeling tired or unwell and in need of a break. Your own health and safety come first! üí™

### FAQs
  - **What is it like being a volunteer?**

      As a volunteer, you can experience a hackathon without the need to hack and compete in it, while also having a mini behind the scenes view of how the organization of hackathons plays out during the event! Responsibilities include but are not limited to registration, set-up and take-down, serving meals, and more.  Volunteer hours are flexible and food and drinks will be provided.

  - **What happens if I'm running late for my shift or I cannot attend anymore? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

      If you are late or cannot attend anymore on the day of the event, please contact your primary volunteers contact through Slack - you should know who this is! 

  - **What if I want to stay after my shift has ended? üïô**

      By all means, go for it! We can always use an extra pair of helping hands, and you're free to leave whenever your shift is over. 

  - **Do I need to bring anything? üéí**

      Wear some comfortable shoes (you'll be moving around a lot!), and anything else you might need to feel at home (e.g. snacks, scarf, hoodie). Feel free to bring your own laptop and charger, but these are optional.
