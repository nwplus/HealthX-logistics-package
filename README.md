# ðŸ’Š The HealthX Logistics Package

## About HealthX 


Mission Statement : A chance for students interested in life sciences and technology to collaborate and tackle problems in the medicine and biology field.

## The Package
This GitBook is a logistics package for HealthX. It is basically a step by step guide on how to plan and execute HealthX. 

This GitBook is divided into 8 catagories of common hackathon planning items, and the planning process is summed up in the timeline. We reccomend first reading through the timeline to get a general sense of what items need to be completed and when. If needed, the items in the timeline will link to another page in the GitBook for further elaboration/explanation. Google Drive items should be accessible via the Google account [here](Miscellaneous_Items/Misc.md).

ðŸ˜Š Happy planning!  - The nwPlus Team âœ¨
