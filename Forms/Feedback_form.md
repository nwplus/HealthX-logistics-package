#  ðŸ“¬ Feedback Form

The Feedback form is a Google Form that is sent out to the public after the completion of the event. We usually send this to the slack as well as through email. We encourage all hackers to fill out the feedback form. Attached below is a link to a skeleton of a HealthX Feedback Form. Please make sure to go through the form carefully and change any of the questions that are not applicable to the event. For mentors and sponsors it is a good idea to ask them for feedback through email, or create another more general feedback form for them!
