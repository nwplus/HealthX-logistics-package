##  ðŸ“¬ Feedback Form

The Feedback form is a Google Form that is sent out to the public after the completion of the event. We usually send this to the slack as well as through email. We encourage all hackers to fill out the feedback form. Attached below is a link to a skeleton of a HealthX Feedback Form. Please make sure to go through the form carefully and change any of the questions that are not applicable to the event. For mentors and sponsors it is a good idea to ask them for feedback through email, or create another more general feedback form for them!

## ðŸ’» Hacker Application Form
The hacker application form is a Google Form that is sent out to the public as part of the volunteer recruitment process. Attached below is a link to a skeleton of a HealthX Volunteer Application Form. Please make sure to go through the form carefully as most of the details will need be changed. For example, the hackathon that the form was based of off offered travel grants, which can be deleted if HealthX is not planning to offer travel grants. Also note that the MLH-related fields are only necessary if HealthX decides to be a MLH member event. In the past, long answer questions have been used as a way to evaluate hacker applications. Long answer questions may not be necessary if HealthX decides to admit hackers on a first come first serve basis.

## ðŸ’ª Volunteer application

The volunteer application form is a Google Form that is sent out to the public as part of the volunteer recruitment process. Attached below is a link to a skeleton of a HealthX Volunteer Application Form. Please make sure to go through the form carefully as most of the details will need to be changed. Also, note that the very bottom field is only necessary if HealthX decides to be a MLH member event. 

It is difficult to accurately gauge the number of volunteers necessary. For reference, at nwHacks 2020, there were 766 hackers, 70 volunteers, and 40 organizers. This was, in general, considered a sufficient amount of volunteers for the event. If we assume there are 5 organizers and 150 hackers for HealthX, then it is recommended to recruit at least 15 volunteers.
