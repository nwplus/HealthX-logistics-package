# ðŸ’ª Volunteer application

The volunteer application form is a Google Form that is sent out to the public as part of the volunteer recruitment process. Attached below is a link to a skeleton of a HealthX Volunteer Application Form. Please make sure to go through the form carefully as most of the details will need to be changed. Also, note that the very bottom field is only necessary if HealthX decides to be a MLH member event. 

It is difficult to accurately gauge the number of volunteers necessary. For reference, at nwHacks 2020, there were 766 hackers, 70 volunteers, and 40 organizers. This was, in general, considered a sufficient amount of volunteers for the event. If we assume there are 5 organizers and 150 hackers for HealthX, then it is recommended to recruit at least 15 volunteers.
